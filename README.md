# infoblox
Infoblox script to restart services where required. Useful when you need to restart the services on a schedule to apply changes in a non-integer number of hours.

Add your own alerting function!

This is semi-abandonware, I may update it, depending on time constraints and access to an Infoblox instance. Didn't see any out there when I went looking though.
